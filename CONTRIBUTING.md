# Contributor Guide

This Juju bundle and associated code is open source ([Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE)) and we actively seek any
community contibutions for code, suggestions and documentation.
Most of the code contributions for Charmed Kubernetes are likely to relate to the charms themselves, rather than
this bundle which is mainly unchanged from release to release.

The [README.md](./README.md) file details how to use this bundle and the bundle commands to compile the bundle.yaml
files for the current Charmed Kubernetes and derived bundles.

Additionally, this bundle uses the Harmony CLA agreement.  It’s the easiest way for you to give us permission to
use your contributions.
In effect, you’re giving us a license, but you still own the copyright — so you retain the right to modify your
