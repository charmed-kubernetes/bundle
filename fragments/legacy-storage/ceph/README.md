# Ceph Storage

Ceph is a free-software storage platform which implements object storage on a
single distributed cluster to provide object, block and file-level storage.

Ceph is similar to GlusterFS or HDFS and works out of the box with Ceph.
It is a major component of OpenStack and is widely used.

This is the fragment for using Ceph without CSI plugins (legacy storage mechanism).

## Operating Kubernetes

A guide to configuring Ceph has been provided on Github here:
