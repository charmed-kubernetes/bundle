## Overview

This is a scaled-out Kubernetes cluster composed of the following components and features:

-   Deep integration for public and private clouds, or bare metal
-   Uses standard upstream Kubernetes
-   Multiple Kubernetes master and worker nodes
-   Extensive CNI options
-   Intra-node TLS by default
-   GPGPU support for high performance AI/ML
-   Managed option available

For a more minimal cluster suitable for testing, deploy the smaller
[kubernetes-core](https://jujucharms.com/kubernetes-core) bundle.

For a lightweight upstream K8s, try [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io)!
